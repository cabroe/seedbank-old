# Auto Learning

This skill allows the agent to autonomously learn from its past interactions and thoughts by searching for patterns and saving new insights as semantic memories.

## Scripts
- `auto-learning.sh`: Periodically triggered learning cycle that fetches recent memories and generates new insights using the configured LLM.
