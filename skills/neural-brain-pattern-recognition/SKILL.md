# Neural Brain - Pattern Recognition

This skill analyzes recent episodic memories to identify recurring behavioral, emotional, or environmental patterns. These patterns are then stored to help the agent adapt its future behavior.

## Scripts
- `bash {baseDir}/scripts/neural-brain-pattern-recognition.sh`: Execution script that retrieves memories, prompts the LLM for pattern analysis, and stores the results.
