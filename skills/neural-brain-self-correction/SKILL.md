# Neural Brain - Self Correction

This skill enables the agent to evaluate its recent actions and thought processes against its core directives and goals. If deviations or errors are detected, it generates corrective guidelines.

## Scripts
- `bash {baseDir}/scripts/neural-brain-self-correction.sh`: Script that reviews recent logs and outputs adjustments or corrections to the agent's context.
