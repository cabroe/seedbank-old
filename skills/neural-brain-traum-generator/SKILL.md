# Neural Brain - Traum Generator

This skill simulates "dreaming" by randomly combining distant or tangentially related memories during idle periods to foster creative associations and unexpected insights.

## Scripts
- `bash {baseDir}/scripts/neural-brain-traum-generator.sh`: Script that runs during low-activity periods, mixing random memory fragments and saving the resulting "dreams".
