# Neural Brain Memory

This skill provides a simple bash-based CLI to interact with the core Neural Brain backend, specifically handling the creation and searching of generalized AI context structures.

## Scripts
- `bash {baseDir}/scripts/neural-brain-memory.sh`:
  - Provide a command line interface wrap around Neural Brain's `POST /agent-contexts` and `GET /search` functionality.

## Usage Guidelines
- Useful for generalized data logging or testing backend connectivity.
