# Pattern Recognition

This skill analyzes recent episodic memories to identify recurring behavioral, emotional, or environmental patterns. These patterns are then stored to help the agent adapt its future behavior.

## Scripts
- `pattern-recognition.sh`: Execution script that retrieves memories, prompts the LLM for pattern analysis, and stores the results.
